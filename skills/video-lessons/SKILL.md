name: video-lessons
description: Turn a YouTube video, playlist, or several videos into a self-contained course of short, quizzed, fact-checked lessons so the user never has to watch the video. Pulls transcripts with Apify, plans one-concept lessons, builds them one at a time, and runs spaced review. Use when the user types /video-lessons, shares a YouTube link and wants to learn from it, says "next" inside a video-lessons topic, or asks to review what they've learned.

# Video Lessons

The user wants to **learn what a video teaches without watching it.** You turn the transcript into a short course in the style of Matt Pocock's `/teach`: a mission, small lessons in the user's zone of proximal development, instant-feedback quizzes, retrieval practice, spaced review, citations.

The lessons must stand alone. If the user has to open the video to follow a lesson, the lesson failed.

## Commands

| Input | Do |
|---|---|
| `/video-lessons <url(s)> [topic]` | [Fetch](#1-fetch) → [Route](#2-route) → [Plan](#3-plan) → build lesson 1 |
| `/video-lessons next [topic]` (or "next") | [Recall check](#6-next) → build the next lesson in the plan |
| `/video-lessons review` | [Spaced review](#7-review) across every topic |

If `next` has no topic and more than one topic has unfinished lessons, ask which one.

The commands work the same in every agent; only the way you invoke the skill differs (`/video-lessons` in Claude Code, `$video-lessons` in Codex, a plain request in Gemini CLI and others).

## Paths

- Skill folder (the folder holding this file): `SKILL_DIR`. Formats in `SKILL_DIR/formats/`, templates in `SKILL_DIR/templates/`, scripts in `SKILL_DIR/scripts/`. Scripts need only Python 3.8+.
- Learning root: `$VIDEO_LESSONS_HOME` if set, otherwise `~/Learning/`. Written below as `~/Learning/`. One folder per topic:

```
~/Learning/<topic>/
  MISSION.md  RESOURCES.md  COMMUNITIES.md  GLOSSARY.md  NOTES.md
  index.html                 course home: every video, its plan, lessons done
  review.json                spaced-review cards (managed by scripts/review.py)
  learning-records/0001-<slug>.md
  reference/<slug>.html      cheat sheets, glossary print-outs
  assets/lesson.css  assets/quiz.js   (copied from templates on topic creation)
  videos/0001-<slug>/
    meta.json                url(s), title, channel, duration, fetched date, cost
    transcripts/<video-id>.md  timestamped transcript, one per video
    PLAN.md                  the lesson plan
    lessons/01-<slug>.html
```

Formats: [MISSION](formats/MISSION-FORMAT.md), [RESOURCES](formats/RESOURCES-FORMAT.md), [COMMUNITIES](formats/COMMUNITIES-FORMAT.md), [GLOSSARY](formats/GLOSSARY-FORMAT.md), [LEARNING-RECORD](formats/LEARNING-RECORD-FORMAT.md), [PLAN](formats/PLAN-FORMAT.md). Read a format before writing that file for the first time in a session.

## 1. Fetch

All transcript work goes through `SKILL_DIR/scripts/fetch_transcript.py`. It reads the Apify token from the `APIFY_TOKEN` environment variable or `~/.config/video-lessons/.env`. Never ask the user to paste the token into chat, never print it, never pass it as a command-line argument.

**1a. List what you're about to fetch (free):**
`python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/fetch_transcript.py list <url> [<url> ...]`
It expands playlists (needs `yt-dlp`) and prints id, seconds, title, and the cost estimate.

**For more than one video, confirm before spending.** Show a table: title, duration, total duration, estimated cost (~$0.003 per video). Propose batches of about 5 videos or 3 hours. Let the user drop videos. Each batch becomes one `videos/NNNN-<slug>/` folder with one merged plan. Later batches skip concepts earlier batches already covered.

**1b. Fetch** (after routing, so you know the folder):
`python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/fetch_transcript.py fetch <urls> --out ~/Learning/<topic>/videos/NNNN-<slug> --lang en[,<original language>]`
It writes `transcripts/<id>.md` (30-second paragraphs stamped `[mm:ss]`, chapters from the description at the top) and `meta.json`, then prints a JSON summary.

- **Non-English video:** put the original language in `--lang` (e.g. `--lang bn,en`) so you get the original captions, not YouTube's translation. You translate while writing lessons.
- **Exit code 3 = some videos have no captions** (listed under `no_captions`). Tell the user, quote the Whisper cost (~$0.012 per minute), and **ask**. Only after a yes, re-run with `--ai-fallback --max-usd <agreed amount>`. Never run it without a yes.
- **No token configured,** but your agent has the Apify MCP server: call the actor `johnvc/YoutubeTranscripts` with `{"youtube_url": [...], "languages": [...], "include_metadata": true}`, save the dataset items to a JSON file, and run `fetch_transcript.py render <items.json> --out <folder>`. Otherwise point the user to the README's "Apify token" section and stop.

## 2. Route

If the user named a topic, use it. Otherwise list `~/Learning/*/MISSION.md`, read their `# Mission:` lines, and guess.
- **Fits an existing topic:** "This looks like *<topic>*. Add it there?" Wait for yes.
- **New topic:** propose a short kebab-case name and ask for **one sentence on why they want this** ("so I can…"). Push once if it's vague. Write a short `MISSION.md` from it; it can grow later. Create the folder, copy `templates/lesson.css` and `templates/quiz.js` into `assets/`, and create `NOTES.md` (empty), `review.json` (`[]`), and `COMMUNITIES.md` (find 2–3 high-reputation communities now, per the format).

## 3. Plan

Read the whole transcript, `MISSION.md`, the topic's `GLOSSARY.md`, and all of `learning-records/`. Write `PLAN.md` per the [format](formats/PLAN-FORMAT.md):

- **One concept per lesson.** A lesson is about 10 minutes of reading plus quiz, whatever the video length.
- A concept that needs more than that is split into parts ("Caching, 1/2"). Tiny concepts next to each other are merged so no lesson is trivial.
- **Skip filler** (intros, sponsor reads, merch, "like and subscribe", course plugs) and list what you skipped and where, so the user knows nothing was lost.
- **Skip what the learning records show the user already knows.** Say so in the plan.
- Order by dependency, not by video order, when the video's order would make a lesson rely on something taught later.
- Mark spots where the speaker refers to something only visible on screen ("as you can see here") with 🎬.
- Order by the mission: concepts that serve it come first or get more depth; off-mission parts are marked optional.

Show the user the plan in chat as a short numbered list, then build lesson 1.

## 4. Build a lesson

Before writing, read `assets/` and reuse it. Every lesson links `../../../assets/lesson.css` and `../../../assets/quiz.js`. Copy the structure from `templates/lesson.html`. If a lesson needs a new reusable component (diagram helper, simulator), put it in `assets/` and link to it. Never inline something a later lesson would duplicate.

**Content: knowledge, then skill.**
1. **The win:** one sentence on what the user can do after this lesson, tied to the mission.
2. **Explanation:** only the knowledge this lesson's skill needs. Tight. Glossary terms used exactly as defined. Each claim from the video cites its timestamp as a link (`<a class="ts" href="https://youtu.be/<id>?t=<seconds>">12:40</a>`), so the user *can* check, but never has to.
3. **Rebuild on-screen visuals** as an inline SVG diagram, a code block, or a table, using context and research. If you can't rebuild one faithfully, add a `🎬 Visual-only` callout with a timestamp link and one sentence saying what's on screen and why it matters.
4. **Fact-check.** Check the video's key claims against high-trust sources (official docs, specs, papers, the creator's own repo, recognised experts) with web search. Add to `RESOURCES.md` per its format. In the lesson:
   - `⚠ Correction`: the video is wrong or outdated. Say what it said, what's true, and cite.
   - `➕ Beyond the video`: something important it left out.
   - `⚖ Creators disagree` (multi-video plans): both positions, then what the high-trust sources say.
   Don't add boxes for padding. None is fine when the video holds up.
5. **Quiz** (`templates/lesson.html` shows the markup; `quiz.js` gives instant feedback and a score). 3–5 questions that make the user *retrieve* or *apply*, not recognise wording. Rules:
   - Every option in a question has the **same number of words**, and character counts as close as you can get.
   - Vary where the correct answer sits across questions. No formatting or ordering clues.
   - Every option has a one-sentence `data-why` explaining why it is right or wrong.
6. **Try it for real:** one small task to do outside the lesson, ideally tied to the user's own work or the mission.
7. **Footer:** previous/next lesson links, links to relevant `reference/` docs, the primary source (the video, plus the best high-trust source from fact-checking), and the line *"Anything unclear? Ask me. I'm your teacher for this."*

**Reference docs.** When a lesson produces something worth looking up later (a command list, a flow, a comparison), add or update a `reference/<slug>.html`: compressed, printable, linked from the lesson. Keep `GLOSSARY.md` as defined in its format: add terms only once the user has shown they can use them (usually after a recall check), not when first introduced.

**Language:** lessons are always in English. For non-English videos, give the original term in brackets the first time a key term appears: "inflation (মুদ্রাস্ফীতি)".

## 5. Human-touch pass

After drafting each lesson (and each new or changed reference doc), run the `human-touch` skill on its **prose**: the win, the explanations, the callout bodies, the "try it" task. It ships next to this skill (`SKILL_DIR/../human-touch/SKILL.md`). Invoke it as a skill if your agent can; otherwise read that file and its `references/` and apply both passes yourself, in embedded mode.

**Do not let it change:** quiz questions, options, and `data-why` text (equal-length rule); glossary terms; code; direct quotes from the video; timestamps; links. Pass it only the prose, then put the edited prose back into the HTML.

Then update `index.html` (from `templates/index.html` the first time): each video, its lessons, ✓ for ones done. Open the lesson in the browser (`xdg-open` on Linux, `open` on macOS, `start ""` on Windows); if that fails, print the path. Tell the user in one or two lines what this lesson covers and that "next" continues.

Add review cards for the lesson's 2–4 core concepts:
`python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/review.py add <topic> "<concept as a question prompt>" "<answer key, one or two sentences>" videos/NNNN-slug/lessons/NN-slug.html`

## 6. Next

1. **Recall check first, in chat, before the next lesson.** Ask 2–3 short open questions on the previous lesson (no options, nothing to recognise). One at a time. The user answers from memory.
2. Grade each honestly. Correct gaps briefly.
3. Write a learning record per its format **only when it qualifies**: the user showed real understanding of something non-trivial, showed a misconception that was corrected, or said they already know something. Coverage alone is not a record. Add glossary terms the user has now used correctly.
4. For each recall question that maps to a review card, run `review.py grade <topic> <card-id> pass|fail`.
5. Adapt: if they missed something central, the next lesson opens by repairing it (or insert a repair lesson into `PLAN.md`). If they nailed it and the next lessons look easy for them, offer to skip or merge.
6. Build the next lesson ([4](#4-build-a-lesson), [5](#5-human-touch-pass)). When the plan is finished, say so and suggest `/video-lessons review` in a day.

## 7. Review

`python3 SKILL_DIR/scripts/review.py due` lists due cards across all topics. If none are due, say when the next one is and stop.

Otherwise run a ~5-minute quiz in chat: up to 10 due cards, **topics mixed together** (interleaving), one question at a time, open-answer. Phrase each question freshly from the card's prompt so the user can't just remember the wording. Grade against the answer key, then `review.py grade <topic> <card-id> pass|fail`. A pass pushes the card further out (1 → 3 → 7 → 21 → 60 → 120 days); a fail resets it to 1 day. End with a one-line score and the next due date. If a card keeps failing, suggest re-reading its lesson (link it).

## Notes and preferences

When the user says how they like to be taught ("shorter lessons", "more code"), record it in the topic's `NOTES.md` and follow it. Preferences that apply to every topic go in `~/Learning/NOTES.md`; read it at the start of every command.
